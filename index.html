  <li>Create the repository on github and clone it to out computer. Then, open it up on vscode with code .</li>
  <li>make sure our main branch is synchronized to the cloud by running "git pull"</li>
  <li>Make a new branch with the command "git checkout -b *newbranchname*"</li>
  <li>ON that new branch, perform all the work needed for the feature you will add</li>
  <li>To stage our changes (we can check what they are with git status), we can run git add . or git add -A to add everything</li>
  <li>After we do that, we want to comment what we did with "git commit -m"Whatever you did in the branch"</li>
  <li>Add it to our github repository by running git push</li>
  <li>If it is a new branch, copy whatever is there to push it up</li>
  <li>On you repository, go and create a pull request, merge your code if okay, and then switch to your main branch locally and repeat from step 2.</li>
